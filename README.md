# Welcome to the Global Customer Churn Prediction Project!

### Project Overview

Hello data enthusiasts! Are you eager to dive into customer churn prediction? This project is designed to explore various binary classification models to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay (retain). Understanding customer churn is essential for businesses to enhance customer retention strategies.

We’ll use several powerful machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Additionally, we’ll utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, ensuring our models perform optimally.

### Key Questions

1.	How effective are Logistic Regression models in predicting customer churn?
2.	How do other models compare to Logistic Regression in terms of performance?
3.	What insights can we gain from predicting churn to shape business strategies?

### Project Components

1.	Setup: Importing Packages and Loading Data: Initial setup for tools and data.
2.	Exploratory Data Visualization: Visual analysis to understand data patterns.
3.	Preprocessing the Data: Data cleaning and preparation for modeling.
4.	PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing feature dimensions while retaining crucial information.
5.	Logistic Regression: Implementing and comparing gradient ascent and Newton’s method.
6.	Other Models: Evaluating Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
7.	Observations / Results: Analyzing model performance and deriving insights.
 
### Requirements

Before we start, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Workflow

1.	Setup: Importing Packages and Loading Data: We’ll start by importing the necessary libraries and loading our dataset from Kaggle. There's a link in the notebook to the dataset.
2.	Exploratory Data Visualization: Through visualizations, we will uncover patterns and relationships in the data, which will help in understanding the features and their distributions.
3.	Preprocessing the Data: This step involves handling missing values, creating dummy variables for categorical data, and scaling the features to prepare them for modeling.
4.	PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: We will use PCA to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information, which helps in improving model performance and reducing computational cost.
5.	Logistic Regression:
	•	Gradient Ascent: Implementing logistic regression using the gradient ascent method.
	•	Newton’s Method: Implementing logistic regression using Newton’s method and comparing its performance with gradient ascent.
6.	Other Models: We’ll explore and compare the performance of various models provided by the sklearn library:
	•	Decision Trees
	•	Support Vector Machines
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors
	•	Random Forest
	•	Gradient Boosting
	7.	Observations / Results: We will analyze the performance of each model, discussing their strengths and weaknesses based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we’ll consider training time and model complexity.

### Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have gained a thorough understanding of different binary classification models and their application to predicting customer churn. You’ll learn how to preprocess data, reduce dimensions with PCA, and evaluate model performance comprehensively. These insights are invaluable for making data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and business strategies.
